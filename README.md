# Error Culture Community Collection

Welcome to the Error Culture Community Collection! This repository serves as a collaborative space to document, share, and learn from error examples. By contributing to this project, you help build a diverse and comprehensive collection of error scenarios, fostering a culture of openness and continuous improvement.

#  Overview

This project provides a growing collection of error examples contributed by the community. All entries are stored in a single CSV file located at:
src/assets/Error_Culture_Community_Collection.csv
Each row in the CSV file represents a unique error example, and the columns provide details about the error and its context. The CSV uses ; as the delimiter to separate columns.
